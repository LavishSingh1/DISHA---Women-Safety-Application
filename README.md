# DISHA---Women-Safety-Application
DISHA is a Women Safety Application designed to provide assistance and information in emergency situations. The application includes features such as user authentication, emergency contact management, and integration with a city map to access emergency services efficiently.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up for a new account or log in with an existing account. Account details are stored securely.

2. **Emergency Contact Management**: Users are required to set up an emergency contact list during account creation. The list ensures quick access to important contacts in case of emergencies.

3. **Admin Authentication**: Admins can sign up for a new account or log in with an existing account. Admin accounts have additional privileges, including access to the city map details.

4. **City Map Integration**: The application includes a city map feature that allows users to find the nearest police station, request emergency assistance, and discover the fastest path from one location to another.

5. **Shortest Path Algorithm**: The application uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of locations in the city map.
